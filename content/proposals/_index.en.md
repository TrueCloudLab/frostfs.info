### Introduction


FrostFS Enhancement Proposals (FEPs) describe standards for the whole FrostFS
stack, including core protocol, API specification and services behavior.

Proposals numbers are assigned by the proposals editors, and once assigned are
never changed.

To learn more about the purpose of FEPs and how to go about writing one, please
refer to [FEP-1]({{< ref "/proposals/proc/fep-0001" >}}).

### FEP Status Key

- **Accepted** — Normative proposal accepted for implementation
- **Active** — Currently valid informational guidance, or an in-use process
- **Deferred** — Inactive draft that may be taken up again at a later time
- **Draft** — Proposal under active discussion and revision
- **Final** — Accepted and implementation complete, or no longer active
- **Provisional** — Provisionally accepted but additional feedback needed
- **Rejected** — Formally declined and will not be accepted
- **Superseded** — Replaced by another succeeding FEP
- **Withdrawn** — Removed from consideration by sponsor or authors
